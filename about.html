  <h1>A Rhetoric and Writing student, a University of Texas sophomore, a law school hopeful. Each of these are true, but they fall short of fully portraying me. They forget to note my interest in the exploration of human connections—that which entices and unites—and my seemingly-perpetual conflict with grammar rules (to abide or not to abide? is it ritualistic or just plain elitist?) and my infatuation with philosophical questions, at the forefront of which is the question of human morality, right and wrong. They also ignore to mention everything I haven’t quite figured out—to be fair, the list is exhaustive and brings with it its own set of growing pains— like how some people simply possess the ability to write poetry or how Bobby Flay is scarcely beat, as well as the internal inkling that, ever-present, moves me to closer to solving dilemmas like these every day. 
So, while a very generic “about me” page could tell you a lot, it could never communicate to you all of the things about me. I hope my writing samples get you closer to that.</h1>
